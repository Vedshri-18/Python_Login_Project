* I have created a registration page.
* While registering there are three checks which was performed:
    - to check if it is a email
    - to check if it is not a duplicate email/ username.
    - to check if it is a valid existing email - (Email Verification)
 * After logging in you can send a mail from registered mail address to anyone.
